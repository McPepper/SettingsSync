# SettingsSync

SettingsSync is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that lets you apply your preferred UI setup across characters in seconds. It’s ideal for fresh installs, new alts, or anyone who wants a consistent, clean UI without manually reconfiguring everything.

## What it does

*   Save, apply, and discard settings from a simple in-game UI.
*   Set it up once and apply it to all characters.
*   Create, select, and delete profiles to reuse setups across characters.
*   Syncs key UI modules (action bars, chat, edit mode, and CVars).
*   Keeps setup fast, repeatable, and consistent.

## Capabilities

*   **ActionBars**: Save and apply multi-action bar visibility toggles.
*   **Chat**: Save and apply chat window names, docking/lock/interactable states, colors, font size, message groups, and channels.
*   **CVars**: Save and apply selected CVars (currently: `autoLootDefault`).
*   **EditMode**: Save and apply the active edit mode layout (preset or custom by name).

## Profiles Support

*   **Create Profile**: Enter a name and click **Create**.
*   **Select Profile**: Use the dropdown to switch profiles.
*   **Delete Profile**: Click **Delete** next to the dropdown.
*   **Save settings**: Saves the current UI state into the active profile.
*   **Apply**: Applies the active profile to the current character.
*   **Discard changes**: Closes the menu without applying anything.

## Commands

*   `/ss` or `/settingssync` — Open the SettingsSync menu.
*   `/ss reset` — Reset the current profile.
*   `/ss resetall` — Reset all profiles.

## Why use it

*   Save time when setting up new characters.
*   Avoid missing small settings that add up over time.
*   Start with a reliable baseline before layering other UI addons.

## Notes

*   Some changes may require a UI reload.
*   For best results, apply SettingsSync before other UI addons.
